Assignment 26th jan

Answer1
A programming language is a formal system designed to communicate instructions to a computer. It is a set of rules and syntax used to write software programs and applications. Programming languages enable humans to create software by providing a way to express logical and computational instructions that can be understood and executed by a computer.

Answer2
Programming languages are essential tools for expressing instructions and logic in a way that computers can understand and execute. Here are several reasons why programming languages are necessary:
Computers operate using machine code, which is a set of binary instructions. Programming languages act as an intermediary between humans and computers, allowing programmers to write code using human-readable syntax that can be translated into machine code.

Answer3
Platform Independence (Write Once, Run Anywhere)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Memory Management (Automatic Garbage Collection)
Rich Standard Library
Security Features

Answer4
In programming and object-oriented languages like Java, Python, C++, and others, an "object" is a fundamental concept. Objects are instances of a class, and they represent real-world entities with properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods). 

Answer5
In Java, a class is a blueprint or a template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It serves as a blueprint for creating objects, which are instances of that class. The class defines the properties (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that the objects of that class will have.

Answer6

In Java, the main() method is a special method that serves as the entry point for a Java application. When you run a Java program, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) looks for the main() method in the class you've specified as the starting point of the program. The main() method must have a specific signature for the JVM to recognize it.
